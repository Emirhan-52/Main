                        <p>
                            As a student in Information Systems (Student ID: 25-657), I'm dedicated to understanding 
                            both the theoretical and practical aspects of web technologies. The coursework has provided 
                            me with hands-on experience in building real-world projects and solving complex problems.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Throughout the fall semester of 2025, I've completed a comprehensive 7-week program covering 
                            everything from basic HTML structure to advanced responsive design techniques. Each week has 
                            brought new challenges and learning opportunities, helping me grow as a developer.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            During my second year of high school, I had the invaluable opportunity to participate in an 
                            Erasmus+ project in Slovakia, representing Taşoluk Anadolu Lisesi. This international experience 
                            allowed me to present my project on a global platform, collaborate with students from different 
                            cultures, and develop essential communication and presentation skills that continue to benefit 
                            me in my academic and professional pursuits.

                        <p>
                            Prior to my current studies in Information Systems, I gained valuable hands-on experience at 
                            <strong>Istanbul Arnavutköy Bilişim Akademisi (İBAK)</strong>, where I worked on drone design 
                            and mechanics projects. This experience provided me with a strong foundation in technical 
                            problem-solving, precision engineering, and collaborative project development.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            At İBAK, I was involved in the design and assembly of drone components, learning about 
                            aerodynamics, electronic systems, and the integration of hardware and software. This 
                            multidisciplinary environment taught me the importance of attention to detail and systematic 
                            approaches to complex technical challenges. The hands-on experience with drones sparked my 
                            interest in the broader field of technology and ultimately led me to pursue software development 
                            and web technologies.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            My commitment to continuous learning has driven me to actively participate in various software 
                            training programs and certification courses. I have successfully completed multiple certifications 
                            in HTML, Python, and API fundamentals through platforms like Sololearn and Parchment. These 
                            certifications validate my technical skills and demonstrate my dedication to staying current 
                            with industry standards and best practices in web development and programming.
